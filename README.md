# NLP-Chatbots

A collection of **simple NLP-based chatbots** built using **Python** and **NLTK**.
This repository demonstrates different chatbot implementations using **rule-based logic**, **tokenization**, **intent matching**, and **style-based responses**.

---

## 📌 Features

* Rule-based NLP chatbot
* Tokenization using **NLTK**
* Intent-based response handling
* Style-based chatbot responses (Funny / Professional / Friendly)
* Dynamic responses for **date** and **time**
* Beginner-friendly and easy to understand
